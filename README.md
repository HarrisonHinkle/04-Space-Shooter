# Space Shooter Project
This was a major project for my Game Technology Class. Every student was tasked with making a 2D space shoot in the Godot engine. This repository contains all the data and assets for a space shooter I made as part of the project. 

I don't really have a name for my game. The idea of the game is simple, you move with the W,A,S,D keys and shoot with either the space bar or by left clicking the mouse. However your ship has two forms that you switch between by either hitting the F key or by right clicking the mouse. Depending on your form, you are immune to certain attacks, the green form passes through all green attacks without taking damage while the red form passes through all red attacks. You can take five hits and your goal is to get as high as a score as possible by killing  the enemies that appear. (note: your ship's blaster can only damage enemy ship, it can not do anything to oncoming fire, you must dodge or switch to the the approrate form.) Most of the assest in the game are very basic as I made most of them myself, aside from the text font, explosion effect, and backround, because it was the easiest way to make sure everything was colored the way I wanted it to be. I'm not much of a sprite artist so it's not that good, but it gets the job done. There was more I wish I could have done before the due date, like add sound effects and music, but I didn't have the time between my other classes and everything else in my life.
