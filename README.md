# Space Shooter Project
This was a major project for my Game Technology Class. Every student was tasked with making a 2D space shoot in the Godot engine. This repository contains all the data and assets for a space shooter I made as part of the project. 

I don't really have a name for my game. The idea of the game is simple you move with the W,A,S,D keys and shoot with either the space bar or by left clicking the left mouse. However you ship have two forms that you switch between by either hitting the F key or by right clicking the mouse. Depending on your form, you are immune to certain attacks, the green form passes through all green attacks without taking damage while the red form passes through all red attacks.
